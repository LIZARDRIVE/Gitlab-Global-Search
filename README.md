# Gitlab-Global-Search
Gitlab Global Search is a simple script allowing to browse all Gitlab projects you have access to in order to find specific strings in it.

I wrote it in order to find COBOL specific programs which are being called in real time by Java applications.

Just adapt it to fit your needs!
